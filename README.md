Develop the app into a complete vehicle management system that not only tracks maintenance but also incorporates features for managing expenses, tracking fuel efficiency, and even integrating with smart car technologies. This system would serve as a central hub for all car-related needs, including:

**Expense Tracking:** Users could log and analyze all car-related expenses, not just maintenance. This could include fuel, insurance, and other recurring costs, providing comprehensive insights into the total cost of ownership.

**Fuel Efficiency Monitoring:** Track and analyze fuel consumption over time. Provide tips and personalized recommendations for improving fuel efficiency based on driving habits and vehicle condition.

**Smart Integration:** Work towards compatibility with connected car technologies, allowing for automatic data syncing directly from the vehicle to the app. For example, the app could automatically receive diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and maintenance alerts issued by the car's onboard computer.
